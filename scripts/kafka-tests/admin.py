    # more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log.

    # then the log compactor considers the log to be eligible for compaction as soon as either:
    # (i) the dirty ratio threshold has been met and the log has had dirty (uncompacted)
    # records for at least the min.compaction.lag.ms duration, or
